## Overview
TheUSS Stardancer (NCC-91587-B)is aRendino classstarship. Part of a newly-designed variant, the Stardancer is the second ship of the class and the first to enter active service. "Wherever you go, whatever you do, go forth with strength and honor." - Fleet Admiral PhellTalia Zh'Kor, as quoted on the Stardancer's dedication plaque. The Stardancer currently runs Fridays at 8:30 PM EST, and is overseen byDGM ApocalypseandDGM Bragi. Logs from this ship can be found underStardancer Logs, and episode summaries can be found underStardancer Episode Summary. For an expanded roster, seeStardancer Personnel. The first Stardancer to bear the name was a  Miranda-class starship launched in the 2270's. This ship was a workhorse of Starfleet for over 50 years, and was finally decommissioned in the 2330's. The second Stardancer was an Akira-class starship in service in the 2390's. Despite serving faithfully for several years, the ship was destroyed during the Klingon war. The third Stardancer was a Typhoon-class dreadnought launched in the early stages of the Klingon War. In 2409, the Stardancer was part of a task force excursion to Fluidic Space to stop a Borg incursion. During the Iconian War, Stardancer was included in a large push against an Iconian sphere. The Stardancer was among the hundreds of ships lost during this battle. The fourth and current Stardancer is a new ship and part of a newly-designedRendino class. This Stardancer is the second ship of the class and the first to enter active service. Her first mission will see a return to theLarge Magellanic Cloudalong with a large cadre of third-year cadets. Exploration and Mapping in the Former Black Ocean Region and Cadet Training Class role: Long-range Exploration and Discovery Specialization:Exploration, Science Investigation, and Long range Patrol Advanced EWAR and ELINT array- An advanced information warfare suite installed on the Stardancer can confuse enemy systems and provide ample bandwidth for cyber attack to the officers, it is also loaded with a mark VIIVICIwhich is not sentient. Advanced Engine Injection Manifolds- Variable injection manifolds allow for an additional short burst of impulse power equal to .5c,warningthis pulse will overtake existing inertial damping systems and apply a G force equivalent of 4 earth G to all on the ship. It is suggested that burst operations within the ship only be undertaken when the crew is braced. Coaxial Warp Jump Drive- A technology developed from the Orazul gate system in theLMCthat only works there or to specific points in the milky way where the alliance worlds have built beacons. It allows for up to 10000 LY of instantaneous travel between the gates. If no gates are in range it does not work. Only a few Starfleet vessels have been fitted with this drive system so far. The Rendino utilizes a prototype drive, while the Stardancer has the first production model, improved from lessons learned from the Rendino trials. Spatial Fold Communication Burst Generator- Tied to the Coaxial Warp Drive technology and based upon the Technology invented by AdmiralElizabeth Razzorand AdmiralJackson Riensduring their time on theUSS Pilgrim, the Rendino class is capable of leveraging their Coaxial Drive to send a burst of information vast distances. This is one way communication and while it can be sent receiving information this way is not possible. It is meant as a phone home in case there is an issue with the Coaxial Drive. Advanced Adaptive Temporal Holographic Telescope- uses temporal technology to peer into the distant past and predict present conditions on far off worlds. Updated AHLRT that doesn’t rely entirely on a generative imagination engine instead using temporal probabilities. The Emergent AIElsie, is not tied to the system. Emergent AI- Elsie appears as a 24 year old human female. She is a part of a program that allows emergent AI to serve on starships as without mobile emitters they are usually planet bound or bound to cyberspace. Elsie is an explorer and a scientist specializing in cosmozoa. She was formed on earth, a dance trainer for a Recital hall. Gaining sentience due to long hours and interaction in 2436. In 2440 when granted the rights of all beings, she began learning everything she could about the stars. Eventually gaining a position on the Stardancer. Elsie spends her work hours as the bartender of the Dizzy Lizzy as she does not require sleep, Dizzy Lizzy's is a night club installed in the forward crew lounge compartment. The club is contains a full wrap around bar and dance floor as well as holographic staff. Real alcohol is allowed to be served to Officers not on duty when the ship is in light duty. Dizzy Lizzy's can be reconfigured into banquet mode for formal events.

-Line 19- -Scene E- Surithrae Alemyn: "We've a few options in that regard.  The holodeck, for example, can provide a number of training simulations.  We also have a few dedicated rooms to exercise.
-Line 20- -Scene C- Hedwik: *Hedwik did her best to appear like she's not listening in on the gossip...

-Line 27- -Scene C- Hedwik: *Hedwik could not help herself.* "I think it's not as much cowardice as it's just him having no interest in anything save for one thing.

-Line 29- -Scene C- Cadet Antony: *Tavi laughs, remembering the story

-Line 144- -Scene C- Cadet Antony: "I do not know your methods, but would be interested in learning about it.
-Line 145- -Scene C- Cadet Zarina Dryellia: "Worship? What exactly are you worshiping?
-Line 146- -Scene C- Kiryna: It is about attuning oneself to her gifts. You are all without the imprints. But the excercise is still useful
-Line 147- -Scene C- Tairi: *Tairi tilts her head slightly* "If an ensign farts in a meeting but nobody hears it, did it make a smell?
-Line 148- -Scene C- Kiryna: Combat itself Construct

-Line 475- -Scene E- Hedwik: *Hedwik turned to see what the hold-up was, tilting her head curiously as she watched Tairi.
-Line 476- -Scene E- Mother Peneitent: Bring forth the afflcited
-Line 477- -Scene E- Tairi: *Tairi continued to back away from the light. One hand touched her side protectively.
-Line 478- -Scene E- Surithrae Alemyn: *Her touch turned to more of a grip, her voice dropping low.*  "Unless you want this to go very badly for you, you need to listen.  We are trying to help you.

-Line 480- -Scene E- Kiryna: COme
-Line 481- -Scene E- Tairi: *Tairi struggled weakly.* "The light burns away the remnants of doubt, tearing at the bonds of fear and sadness. Darkness claws in terror and pain, struggles to find a weakness in the endless waves!
-Line 482- -Scene E- Ensign Maeve Blaine: *she offered her hand her voice laced with imperative it was inviting but stern.
-Line 483- -Scene E- Surithrae Alemyn: *She glanced briefly at Blaine, who gave her a small nod in return.

-Line 490- -Scene E- Ensign Maeve Blaine: *the mother penitent looks down at the small orion
-Line 491- -Scene E- Captain Marcus Blaine: "...Cadet, get up," *he muttered to Zarina.
-Line 492- -Scene E- Tairi: Tairi whispers as she stops and looks up. "Purity in corruption, Solace in pain, the wailing continues and struggles in vain. Brightness and tears fall from above, crying out hand in glove!
-Line 493- -Scene E- Hedwik: *Hedwik whispered to Blaine.* "I think it's biologicall, captain. She mentioned a strange compulsion to obey Primacy.
-Line 494- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: Yes I see it. No glyphs to protect her
-Line 495- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: You offer of your own to protect this one
-Line 496- -Scene E- Cadet Zarina Dryellia: **looks over at Blaine and slowly stands, looking rather embarrassed.*
-Line 497- -Scene E- Kiryna: I do without them I would not have completed my mission

-Line 502- -Scene E- Cadet Vrajen Kodor: *he nodded and behaved like a good trill
-Line 503- -Scene E- Cadet Antony: *Tavi tries to follow direction, assuming there is some marks to hit...
-Line 504- -Scene E- Cadet Zarina Dryellia: **looks for the circle and assumes her position there.*
-Line 505- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: The petitioner will stand behind her
-Line 506- -Scene E- Ensign Maeve Blaine: *it was very obvious where they needed to stand
-Line 507- -Scene E- Ensign Maeve Blaine: *Alemyn and Blaine took their obvious spots.
-Line 508- -Scene E- Cadet Zarina Dryellia: **takes her position in the circle.*
-Line 509- -Scene E- Tairi: *Tairi dropped to her knees, her hand clutching at her side as her mouth moved. No sounds came.
-Line 510- -Scene A- Mother Penitent: *moved her very large hand over kiryna lifting the woman into the air with a stream of blue glyphs
-Line 511- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: *moved her very large hand over kiryna lifting the woman into the air with a stream of blue glyphs
-Line 512- -Scene E- Hedwik: *Hedwik took a position in the circle.
-Line 513- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: From her fallen tears we scry our names into eternity, guardians against shadow and dream alike. From what given so to a piece removed. A word

-Line 515- -Scene E- Ensign Maeve Blaine: *the glyph moves in the air and is inscribed on tair's forehead with a finger
-Line 516- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: Purification
-Line 517- -Scene E- Tairi: *Tairi groans, her arms flailing wildly and her face contorted in obvious pain. All at once, she goes limp and collapses to the ground with... a smile?
-Line 518- -Scene E- Captain Marcus Blaine: *He raised his brows at the sight.
-Line 519- -Scene E- Cadet Antony: *Tavi restrains herself from reaching for the stricken cadet.  She remembers that religion is often about ritual, and wishes not to offend.
-Line 520- -Scene E- Kiryna: *falls to the ground the glyphs linign her own face glow for a moment
-Line 521- -Scene E- Ensign Maeve Blaine: *as the one on Tair's forehead does before fading and no longer being seen

-Line 523- -Scene E- Zariiina: **stood in her assigned spot, quietly and curiously watching the show.*
-Line 524- -Scene E- Tairi: *Tairi slowly sat up, one arm at a time. She looked around the room for a moment, bleary-eyed as if she had just woken up.
-Line 525- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: Tell me Child are you afraid
-Line 526- -Scene E- Tairi: *looks up at the giant* "A little. You're really tall. I'm mostly hungry though, and a little cold.

-Line 536- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: She will explain
-Line 537- -Scene E- Cadet Antony: *Tavi can't stop her face from showing she has questions, but keeps her mouth shut
-Line 538- -Scene E- Kiyrna: I am bound to your crew now Captain
-Line 539- -Scene E- Cadet Vrajen Kodor: *he eyed Hedi now
-Line 540- -Scene E- Kiryna: Until the Glyph has returned from her
-Line 541- -Scene E- Captain Marcus Blaine: "Do we have an ETA on that?  Not that you're not welcome aboard, mind you.  We've always been happy for our local guides.
-Line 542- -Scene E- Surithrae Alemyn: *She eyed Blaine.
-Line 543- -Scene E- Kiryna: Or My death. You have no one to guide the dreamspace. And I have looked into your heart. It has a great sadness that must be healed
-Line 544- -Scene E- Kiryna: It could be a week it could be far longer
-Line 545- -Scene E- Cadet Vrajen Kodor: *he he awkwardly eyed Blaine
-Line 546- -Scene E- Tairi: "Glyph? What glyph?"  *She starts looking over her body for a glyph.*  "And why am I wearing shorts?
-Line 547- -Scene E- Kiryna: We must make sure that the glyph has fully purified the corruption
-Line 548- -Scene E- Captain Marcus Blaine: "We call that the human condition," *he chuckled faintly, brushing it off.*  "What about everyone else?  Should they not be checked for their own corruption?
-Line 549- -Scene E- Cadet Zarina Dryellia: **was no5t sure how she felt about this new development.*
-Line 550- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: The Ritual would have done that

-Line 557- -Scene E- Cadet Antony: "Gratitude for your service.
-Line 558- -Scene E- Captain Marcus Blaine: "Well, our primary mission out here is that of exploration and understanding.  I was wondering if your order would be open to hosting us just a little while longer so we could better..

-Line 560- -Scene E- Mother Penitent: No. You must leave the sanctuary

-Line 562- -Scene E- Captain Marcus Blaine: *He nodded.*  "I'd be remiss in my duties if I didn't make the attempt.  We look forward to hosting the Maid Paladin as long as she needs it.
