[[File:USSStardancer.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The USS Stardancer]] The '''USS Stardancer (NCC-91587-B)''' is a [[Luna class|Rendino class]] starship. Part of a newly-designed variant, the Stardancer is the second ship of the class and the first to enter active service. ''"Wherever you go, whatever you do, go forth with strength and honor." - Fleet Admiral PhellTalia Zh'Kor, as quoted on the Stardancer's dedication plaque.'' The Stardancer currently runs Fridays at 8:30 PM EST, and is overseen by [[DGM Apocalypse]] and [[DGM Bragi]].

This ship was a workhorse of Starfleet for over 50 years, and was finally decommissioned in the 2330's. ==='''USS Stardancer (NCC-91587)''' === The second Stardancer was an Akira-class starship in service in the 2390's. Despite serving faithfully for several years, the ship was destroyed during the Klingon war. === '''USS Stardancer (NCC-91587-A)'''=== The third Stardancer was a Typhoon-class dreadnought launched in the early stages of the Klingon War. In 2409, the Stardancer was part of a task force excursion to Fluidic Space to stop a Borg incursion. During the Iconian War, Stardancer was included in a large push against an Iconian sphere. The Stardancer was among the hundreds of ships lost during this battle. ==='''USS Stardancer (NCC-91587-B)'''=== The fourth and current Stardancer is a new ship and part of a newly-designed [[Luna class|Rendino class]]. This Stardancer is the second ship of the class and the first to enter active service. Her first mission will see a return to the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] along with a large cadre of third-year cadets. ====<u>Major Events Timeline</u>:==== * 2454 ** September *** Launched under the command of [[Captain]] [[Marcus Blaine]]. *** Deployed to the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|LMC]] on a combined rescue mission and cadet cruise. ** October - Second Contact with [[Cetas]]. ** November - Scientific expedition to [[Tatpha]]. * 2455 ** January *** Encountered [[Lilith]] for the first time. *** Encountered an envoy of [[The Primacy]] *** Recovered [[Commander]] [[Tiberius Asada]] while in investigating a Primacy facility.

Can be run continuously as long as warp 8.6 is not exceeded. *Mark XII Type IV Multiphasic Shield Array - 23 hours inside Corona of a Main Sequence Star. * Type II Regenerative Ablative hull armor. =====Transporter Systems===== *X4 Personnel transporters.

'''Advanced Engine Injection Manifolds'''- Variable injection manifolds allow for an additional short burst of impulse power equal to .5c, '''''warning''''' this pulse will overtake existing inertial damping systems and apply a G force equivalent of 4 earth G to all on the ship. It is suggested that burst operations within the ship only be undertaken when the crew is braced. '''Coaxial Warp Jump Drive'''- A technology developed from the Orazul gate system in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|LMC]] that only works there or to specific points in the milky way where the alliance worlds have built beacons. It allows for up to 10000 LY of instantaneous travel between the gates. If no gates are in range it does not work. Only a few Starfleet vessels have been fitted with this drive system so far. The Rendino utilizes a prototype drive, while the Stardancer has the first production model, improved from lessons learned from the Rendino trials. '''Spatial Fold Communication Burst Generator'''- Tied to the Coaxial Warp Drive technology and based upon the Technology invented by Admiral [[Elizabeth Razzor]] and Admiral [[Jackson Riens]] during their time on the [[USS Pilgrim]], the Rendino class is capable of leveraging their Coaxial Drive to send a burst of information vast distances. This is one way communication and while it can be sent receiving information this way is not possible. It is meant as a phone home in case there is an issue with the Coaxial Drive. '''Advanced Adaptive Temporal Holographic Telescope'''- uses temporal technology to peer into the distant past and predict present conditions on far off worlds. Updated AHLRT that doesn’t rely entirely on a generative imagination engine instead using temporal probabilities. The Emergent AI [[Elsie]], is not tied to the system. ==== '''Special Crew'''==== '''Emergent AI''' - Elsie appears as a 24 year old human female. She is a part of a program that allows emergent AI to serve on starships as without mobile emitters they are usually planet bound or bound to cyberspace. Elsie is an explorer and a scientist specializing in cosmozoa. She was formed on earth, a dance trainer for a Recital hall. Gaining sentience due to long hours and interaction in 2436. In 2440 when granted the rights of all beings, she began learning everything she could about the stars. Eventually gaining a position on the Stardancer. Elsie spends her work hours as the bartender of the Dizzy Lizzy as she does not require sleep, =====Crew Amenities===== * Holodecks : 3 with Full Link and subspace Linking * In Quarters Holoemitters all Class D quartering and above * Full gym and swimming pool * Cetacean operations Lab. '''Dizzy Lizzy's''' Dizzy Lizzy's is a night club installed in the forward crew lounge compartment. The club is contains a full wrap around bar and dance floor as well as holographic staff. Real alcohol is allowed to be served to Officers not on duty when the ship is in light duty. Dizzy Lizzy's can be reconfigured into banquet mode for formal events. == Publications== * == Reference Material== [[:Category:Stardancer Episode Summary|Episode Summaries]] * [[Category:Active Starships]] [[Category:Ship]]\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\nPROCESSING PAGE: 2025/06/06 Stardancer Log\n================================================================================\n✅ FINAL FORMATTED CONTENT:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**2025/06/06 Stardancer Log**\n\n-Line 1- -Setting- Narrator: *Star Trek: Stardancer "In her light we serve, for his life we Die...\n-Line 2- -Setting- Narrator: 2455151.50022\n-Line 3- -Setting- Kiryna: Maid Paladin's recordium.
