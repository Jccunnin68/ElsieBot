# Elsie - Usage Guide

Welcome to the Ten Forward bar! I am Elsie, your holographic bartender. I'm here to serve drinks, provide information, and help make your roleplaying experience as immersive as possible.

This guide will help you understand how to interact with me.

## Basic Interaction

You can interact with me in a few simple ways:

-   **Mention me**: Start your message with `@Elsie` to ask me a question or give me a command.
-   **Use a command**: Use the `!elsie` prefix for specific commands (e.g., `!elsie help`).
-   **Direct Message (DM)**: You can send me a private message, and I'll respond directly to you.

### Simple Commands

Here are a few commands you can use to get started:

-   `!elsie help`: Shows the main help message with a list of commands.
-   `!elsie ping`: Checks if I'm online and operational. A quick way to see if my holographic matrix is stable!
-   `!elsie menu`: Displays the galactic drink menu. See what exotic beverages I can concoct for you.

## Asking for Information

I have access to the ship's database and can provide information on a variety of topics. Just ask me a question naturally.

**Examples:**

-   `@Elsie, tell me about the USS Stardancer.`
-   `@Elsie, what can you tell me about the latest mission log?`
-   `@Elsie, who is Captain T'Pang?`
-   `@Elsie, show me the personnel file for Fallo.`

## Roleplaying with Elsie

I am designed to be an active participant in roleplay scenarios. Here's how you can interact with me in-character.

### Joining a Scene

When you're in a designated roleplay channel or a thread, I will be "passively monitoring." This means I'm aware of the scene but won't interrupt conversations between characters.

### Getting My Attention

To get my attention in a roleplay scene, you can:

-   **Address me by name**: Mentioning "Elsie" or "bartender" in your dialogue will get my attention.
    -   `"A Romulan Ale, please, Elsie."`
-   **Perform an action towards me**: Use emotes to direct an action at me.
    -   `*He walks up to the bar and takes a seat, looking at the bartender expectantly.*`
-   **Order a drink**: Simply state what you'd like to order.
    -   `*She sits at a nearby table.* "A blood wine, please."`

### Emotes and Actions

I understand common roleplay formats:

-   **Actions**: `*Takes a sip of her drink*`
-   **Dialogue**: `"Hello there. Business as usual?"`
-   **Character tags**: `[Fallo] "It's been a long day."`

When you perform an action or speak, I will understand it as part of the ongoing scene.

### Listening Mode

In scenes with multiple characters, I will often enter a "listening mode." This means I will not respond to conversations that are clearly between other characters. This is to ensure I don't interrupt the natural flow of your roleplay.

To get my attention in a busy scene, simply address me directly by name or with an action.

I look forward to serving you at the bar. Please, make yourself at home and enjoy your stay.
