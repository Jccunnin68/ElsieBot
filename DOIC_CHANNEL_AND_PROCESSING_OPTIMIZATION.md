# DOIC Channel Handling & Character Processing Optimization

## Overview
Enhanced the AI system to properly handle [DOIC] channel content and optimize character processing flow to prevent duplication and improve efficiency.

## Problem Statement
1. **[DOIC] Channel Content**: No special handling for [DOIC] channel content, which is primarily narration or other character dialogue, rarely from the character@account_name speaking
2. **Character Processing Duplication**: Character rules were being applied multiple times - once locally and again by the secondary LLM processor
3. **Processing Inefficiency**: Local character processing was running even when content would be sent to secondary LLM for processing

## Solution Implementation

### 1. DOIC Channel Detection and Handling

#### `is_doic_channel_content(content: str) -> bool`
Detects [DOIC] channel content using multiple patterns:
- `[DOIC]` - Direct DOIC tag
- `@DOIC` - DOIC mentions  
- `DOIC:` - DOIC prefix

#### `parse_doic_content(content: str, ship_name: Optional[str] = None) -> str`
Special parsing rules for DOIC content:
- **Removes [DOIC] tags** but preserves content
- **Treats character@account patterns as narration** about the character, not the character speaking
- **Formats as narrative description** using `*text*` format
- **Handles regular DOIC content as environmental narration**

**Example:**
```
Input:
[DOIC] The bridge is quiet as the crew works at their stations
captain_marcus@stardancer: [Captain Blaine] reviews the tactical display
[DOIC] Red alert klaxons begin to sound throughout the ship

Output:
*The bridge is quiet as the crew works at their stations*
*captain_marcus: [Captain Blaine] reviews the tactical display*
*Red alert klaxons begin to sound throughout the ship*
```

### 2. Character Processing Optimization

#### `should_skip_local_character_processing(content: str) -> bool`
Determines when to skip local character processing:
- **Skip if content will go to secondary LLM** (over 14,000 characters)
- **Let secondary LLM handle character disambiguation** instead of doing it twice
- **Still handle DOIC content specially** since it needs different parsing rules

#### Processing Flow Optimization
- **Small content (< 14,000 chars)**: Apply local character processing, goes to main LLM
- **Large content (≥ 14,000 chars)**: Skip local processing, let secondary LLM handle it
- **DOIC content**: Always apply special DOIC parsing regardless of size

### 3. Secondary LLM Prompt Enhancement

#### Updated Character-Aware Prompts
**Before (Incorrect):**
```
- ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CHARACTER CORRECTIONS ALREADY COMPLETED
- DO NOT re-apply any character name corrections - preserve exactly as provided
```

**After (Correct):**
```
- ⚠️ IMPORTANT: PERFORM CHARACTER DISAMBIGUATION
- Apply character name corrections using ship context
- Resolve ambiguous character names with proper ranks/titles
- Filter OOC content: ((text)), //text, [ooc text], ooc:
```

#### DOIC Channel Rules Added to Secondary LLM
```
- [DOIC] Channel Rules:
  * Content in [DOIC] channels is primarily narration or other character dialogue
  * Rarely will [DOIC] content be from the character@account_name speaking
  * Treat [DOIC] content as environmental/narrative description
```

### 4. Character Processing Deduplication

#### Fixed Double Processing Issue
**Problem**: `parse_log_characters()` was calling `parse_character_dialogue()`, causing character corrections to be applied twice

**Solution**: Removed the duplicate call to `parse_character_dialogue()` in `parse_log_characters()` to prevent character name duplication like "Captain Captain Marcus Blaine Blaine"

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`ai_agent/handlers/ai_wisdom/llm_query_processor.py`**
   - Updated `_create_character_aware_log_summary_prompt()` to actively perform character processing

   - Added DOIC channel rules to secondary LLM prompts

2. **`ai_agent/handlers/ai_wisdom/content_retriever.py`**
   - Added `is_doic_channel_content()` function
   - Added `parse_doic_content()` function  
   - Added `should_skip_local_character_processing()` function
   - Updated `parse_log_characters()` and `parse_character_dialogue()` with optimization logic
   - Fixed character processing duplication issue

3. **`test_refactor.py`**
   - Added `test_doic_channel_and_processing_optimization()` comprehensive test function

### Processing Flow Diagram
```
Content Input
     ↓
Is DOIC Content? → Yes → Apply DOIC Parsing Rules
     ↓ No
Content Size Check
     ↓
< 14,000 chars → Apply Local Character Processing → Main LLM
     ↓
≥ 14,000 chars → Skip Local Processing → Secondary LLM (with character rules)
```

## Validation & Testing

### Test Coverage
1. **DOIC Channel Detection**: Validates proper detection of [DOIC] content vs regular content
2. **DOIC Content Parsing**: Ensures proper narrative formatting and tag removal
3. **Processing Optimization**: Confirms small content gets local processing, large content skips it
4. **Integrated Character Processing**: Validates end-to-end character processing without duplication

## Key Benefits

### 1. Proper DOIC Handling
- **Narrative Context**: [DOIC] content properly treated as environmental/narrative description
- **Character Attribution**: Prevents misattribution of DOIC narration to specific characters
- **Immersion**: Maintains proper roleplay context for DOIC channel content

### 2. Processing Efficiency
- **Eliminates Duplication**: Character processing no longer applied twice
- **Optimized Flow**: Local processing skipped when secondary LLM will handle it
- **Resource Savings**: Reduces unnecessary computation for large content

### 3. Character Accuracy
- **No Name Duplication**: Fixed "Captain Captain Marcus Blaine Blaine" issues
- **Proper Disambiguation**: Secondary LLM now actively performs character resolution
- **Context Awareness**: Ship context properly used for character identification

### 4. System Reliability
- **Clear Separation**: Distinct handling for different content types and sizes
- **Fallback Safety**: DOIC content still processed even when skipping other local processing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage ensures reliability

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Additional Channel Types**: Extend special handling to other channel types if needed
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Make the 14,000 character threshold configurable
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for processing optimization effectiveness
4. **Advanced DOIC Rules**: More sophisticated DOIC content classification if needed

### Monitoring Points
- **Character Processing Accuracy**: Monitor for any remaining duplication issues
- **DOIC Content Quality**: Ensure narrative formatting meets expectations  
- **Processing Performance**: Track efficiency gains from optimization
- **Secondary LLM Effectiveness**: Monitor character disambiguation quality in secondary LLM
