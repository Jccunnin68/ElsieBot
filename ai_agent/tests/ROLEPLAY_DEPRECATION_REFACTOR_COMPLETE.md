## 📊 Total Impact Summary

### Code Removal Statistics
- **Files Deleted:** 2 major deprecated entry points
- **Lines Removed:** 1,330+ lines of deprecated code
- **Functions Removed:** 5+ major deprecated functions
- **Comments Cleaned:** All legacy markers and deprecated references
- **Dependencies Fixed:** 1 major circular import resolved

### Architecture Transformation

**BEFORE REFACTOR:**
```
Mixed Legacy System:
├── strategy_engine.py (deprecated redirects)
├── roleplay_handler.py (deprecated redirects)  
├── should_elsie_respond_in_roleplay() (deprecated logic)
├── process_roleplay_strategy() (deprecated logic)
├── getNextResponseEnhanced() (deprecated redirect)
├── Multiple decision pathways causing confusion
├── Legacy compatibility code slowing execution
└── Circular import dependencies
```

**AFTER REFACTOR:**
```
Unified Enhanced System:
