Logic Engine for Query Disambiguation
======================================

This module provides a dedicated interface for using a local LLM to perform
specific, narrowly-defined tasks. Its primary role in the agentic architecture
is to determine the correct database category for a general user query,
avoiding the need for complex heuristic logic.
