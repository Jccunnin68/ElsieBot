USS Stardancer (NCC-1987)
The first Stardancer to bear the name was a Miranda-class starship launched in the 2270's. This ship was a workhorse of Starfleet for over 50 years, and was finally decommissioned in the 2330's.

USS Stardancer (NCC-91587)
The second Stardancer was an Akira-class starship in service in the 2390's. Despite serving faithfully for several years, the ship was destroyed during the Klingon war.

USS Stardancer (NCC-91587-A)
The third Stardancer was a Typhoon-class dreadnought launched in the early stages of the Klingon War. In 2409, the Stardancer was part of a task force excursion to Fluidic Space to stop a Borg incursion. During the Iconian War, Stardancer was included in a large push against an Iconian sphere. The Stardancer was among the hundreds of ships lost during this battle.

USS Stardancer (NCC-91587-B)
The fourth and current Stardancer is a new ship and part of a newly-designed Rendino class. This Stardancer is the second ship of the class and the first to enter active service. Her first mission will see a return to the Large Magellanic Cloud along with a large cadre of third-year cadets.

Special Systems
Advanced EWAR and ELINT array - An advanced information warfare suite installed on the Stardancer can confuse enemy systems and provide ample bandwidth for cyber attack to the officers, it is also loaded with a mark VII VICI which is not sentient.

Advanced Engine Injection Manifolds- Variable injection manifolds allow for an additional short burst of impulse power equal to .5c, warning this pulse will overtake existing inertial damping systems and apply a G force equivalent of 4 earth G to all on the ship. It is suggested that burst operations within the ship only be undertaken when the crew is braced.

Coaxial Warp Jump Drive- A technology developed from the Orazul gate system in the LMC that only works there or to specific points in the milky way where the alliance worlds have built beacons. It allows for up to 10000 LY of instantaneous travel between the gates. If no gates are in range it does not work. Only a few Starfleet vessels have been fitted with this drive system so far. The Rendino utilizes a prototype drive, while the Stardancer has the first production model, improved from lessons learned from the Rendino trials.

Spatial Fold Communication Burst Generator- Tied to the Coaxial Warp Drive technology and based upon the Technology invented by Admiral Elizabeth Razzor and Admiral Jackson Riens during their time on the USS Pilgrim, the Rendino class is capable of leveraging their Coaxial Drive to send a burst of information vast distances. This is one way communication and while it can be sent receiving information this way is not possible. It is meant as a phone home in case there is an issue with the Coaxial Drive.

Advanced Adaptive Temporal Holographic Telescope- uses temporal technology to peer into the distant past and predict present conditions on far off worlds. Updated AHLRT that doesnâ€™t rely entirely on a generative imagination engine instead using temporal probabilities. The Emergent AI Elsie, is not tied to the system.

Special Crew
Emergent AI - Elsie appears as a 24 year old human female. She is a part of a program that allows emergent AI to serve on starships as without mobile emitters they are usually planet bound or bound to cyberspace. Elsie is an explorer and a scientist specializing in cosmozoa. She was formed on earth, a dance trainer for a Recital hall. Gaining sentience due to long hours and interaction in 2436. In 2440 when granted the rights of all beings, she began learning everything she could about the stars. Eventually gaining a position on the Stardancer. Elsie spends her work hours as the bartender of the Dizzy Lizzy as she does not require sleep,

Crew Amenities

Dizzy Lizzy's

Dizzy Lizzy's is a night club installed in the forward crew lounge compartment. The club is contains a full wrap around bar and dance floor as well as holographic staff. Real alcohol is allowed to be served to Officers not on duty when the ship is in light duty. Dizzy Lizzy's can be reconfigured into banquet mode for formal events.
