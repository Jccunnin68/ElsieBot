# Main AI Engine Narrative Summation Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the main AI engine to detect when it receives processed content from the secondary LLM processor and apply appropriate narrative summation techniques, particularly for log data.

## Problem Statement
The secondary LLM processor was correctly handling character disambiguation and content length reduction, but the main AI engine was treating all content the same way - whether it was raw unprocessed data or pre-processed summaries. This resulted in the main AI simply presenting processed data rather than creating engaging narrative summaries.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Content Detection Functions

#### `detect_processed_content(content: str) -> bool`
Detects if content has been processed by the secondary LLM processor by checking for:
- **Length indicators**: Content between 5,000-14,000 characters (typical processed range)
- **Content structure indicators**: Phrases like "comprehensive summary", "key events", "character interactions", "mission details", "essential information"
- **Fallback response indicators**: Using existing `is_fallback_response()` function
- **Processing artifacts**: Truncation messages, rate limiting indicators

Returns `True` if 2+ indicators are present, suggesting processed content.

#### `is_log_content(content: str, user_message: str) -> bool`
Determines if content is primarily log-based and should receive narrative treatment by checking:
- **User query indicators**: Words like 'log', 'logs', 'mission', 'what happened', 'events', 'summarize', 'summary', 'recap'
- **Content structure indicators**: Formatted log titles, log separators, mission logs, stardates, captain's logs

Returns `True` if both user wants logs AND content contains log-like structure.

### 2. Enhanced Prompting System

#### Narrative Log Summation Prompt
When `detect_processed_content() AND is_log_content()` are both true:
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - NARRATIVE LOG SUMMATION:
The information below has been pre-processed and summarized from mission logs. Your task is to create an engaging, narrative summary that brings these events to life. DO NOT simply present the data - instead:

- Transform the processed information into a compelling narrative story
- Focus on the human drama, character interactions, and emotional moments
- Describe events as if telling an engaging story to someone who wasn't there
- Highlight key decisions, conflicts, and their consequences
- Bring out character personalities and relationships
- Create a flowing narrative that connects events chronologically
- Use vivid, descriptive language to make the events feel immediate and real
- Focus on WHO did WHAT and WHY, with emphasis on motivations and outcomes

NARRATIVE STYLE:
- Present events as a story, not a data summary
- Use engaging, descriptive language
- Connect events with narrative flow ("Meanwhile...", "As a result...", "This led to...")
- Emphasize character moments and dialogue
- Describe the stakes and tension in situations
- Make the reader feel like they're experiencing the events
```

#### Enhanced Information Presentation Prompt
When `detect_processed_content()` is true but `is_log_content()` is false:
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - ENHANCED INFORMATION PRESENTATION:
The information below has been pre-processed and summarized. Your task is to present this information in a comprehensive, engaging way that goes beyond simple data presentation:

- Organize the information logically and clearly
- Provide context and background to help understanding
- Explain relationships between different pieces of information
- Highlight the most important and relevant details
- Present information in a way that's easy to understand and actionable
- Add your expertise and insights where appropriate
- Make connections that help the user understand the bigger picture
```

#### Standard Context
When content is not processed, uses the existing standard context for comprehensive information delivery.

### 3. Integration Points

#### Main AI Engine (`ai_engine.py`)
- Added content detection logic in `generate_ai_response_with_decision()`
- Enhanced context building with conditional prompting
- Added debug logging for processed content detection
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

#### Dependencies
- Imports `is_fallback_response` from `llm_query_processor.py`
- Uses existing personality context detection
- Integrates with existing conversation history formatting

## Testing Implementation
