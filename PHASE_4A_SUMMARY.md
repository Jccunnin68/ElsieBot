# Phase 4A: LLM Processor Character Rule Integration

## Overview

Phase 4A enhances the LLM query processor to understand and apply character rules during summary generation. This ensures that when large content is processed through the LLM for summarization, character names are properly disambiguated and DGM control patterns are recognized.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Character Context Extraction

**File**: `ai_agent/handlers/ai_wisdom/llm_query_processor.py`

Added `CharacterContext` dataclass and `_extract_character_context()` method:

```python
@dataclass
class CharacterContext:
    """Character context information for LLM processing"""
    ship_context: Optional[str] = None
    dgm_accounts: List[str] = None
    character_designations: List[str] = None
    ooc_patterns_found: List[str] = None
    roleplay_active: bool = False
```

**Features**:
- Extracts ship context from log content using existing `extract_ship_name_from_log_content()`
- Detects DGM accounts: `['liorexus', 'isis', 'cygnus', 'illuice', 'captain_rien', 'captain_riens']`
- Identifies character designation patterns: `[Character]`, `Character:`, `(Character)`
- Recognizes OOC patterns: `((text))`, `//text`, `[ooc text]`, `ooc:`
- Checks roleplay state from state manager

### 2. Character-Aware Prompt Generation

**Enhanced Methods**:
- `_process_log_data_with_character_rules()` - Enhanced log processing
- `_process_general_data_with_character_rules()` - Enhanced general data processing
- `_create_character_aware_log_summary_prompt()` - Character-aware log prompts
- `_create_character_aware_general_summary_prompt()` - Character-aware general prompts

**Character Rules Integrated**:
- Ship context for disambiguation
- DGM character control patterns recognition
- OOC content filtering instructions
- Specific character disambiguation rules:
  - `'Tolena'` â†’ `'Ensign Maeve Blaine'` (Stardancer) or `'Doctor t'Lena'` (other ships)
  - `'Blaine'` â†’ `'Captain Marcus Blaine'` (Stardancer) or `'Ensign Maeve Blaine'` (context dependent)
  - `'Trip'` â†’ Enterprise character (avoid confusion with 'trip' as journey)

### 3. Roleplay Context Detection

**File**: `ai_agent/handlers/ai_wisdom/context_coordinator.py`

Added `_detect_roleplay_context()` function:

```python
def _detect_roleplay_context(strategy: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Detect if we're in a roleplay context for LLM processor integration"""
```

**Detection Methods**:
- Direct roleplay approaches (starts with 'roleplay')
- Roleplay indicators in strategy values
- Roleplay state from state manager

**Integration**: All context builder calls now receive `is_roleplay` parameter

### 4. Content Retriever Enhancement

**File**: `ai_agent/handlers/ai_wisdom/content_retriever.py`

Enhanced `_get_roleplay_context_from_caller()`:
- Expanded call stack inspection to include `context_coordinator.py` and `non_roleplay_context_builder.py`
- Added fallback to roleplay state manager
- Improved roleplay context detection accuracy

## Integration with Existing System

### Backward Compatibility
- âœ… All existing LLM processor functionality preserved
- âœ… Original prompt methods still available as fallbacks
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing APIs

### Enhanced Processing Flow
1. **Content Size Check**: Determines if LLM processing is needed (>14,000 chars)
2. **Character Context Extraction**: Analyzes content for character rules
3. **Enhanced Prompt Generation**: Creates character-aware prompts with disambiguation rules
4. **LLM Processing**: Processes content with character rule awareness
5. **Result Return**: Returns processed content with proper character handling

### Roleplay Context Propagation
- Context coordinator detects roleplay state
- Roleplay context passed to all content builders
- Content retriever enhanced call stack inspection
- LLM processor receives roleplay context for appropriate fallback responses

## Benefits
