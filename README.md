# Elsie - AI Holographic Bartender

Elsie is a sophisticated, containerized Discord bot designed for the 22nd Mobile Daedalus Fleet community. She functions as a holographic bartender and stellar cartographer, capable of accessing a comprehensive, self-updating fleet database to provide information on mission logs, ship specifications, personnel files, and more.

## Features

- **In-Character Persona**: Elsie maintains a consistent persona as a sophisticated, alluring, and intelligent holographic bartender with a background in dance and music.
- **Dynamic Response Strategy**: Elsie analyzes user messages to determine the most appropriate response strategy, switching between simple chat, database lookups, and specialized queries.
- **Database Integration**: She can access a local database for information about ship logs, characters, and other lore-specific details.
- **Federation Archives Access**: Elsie can query an external API (Memory Alpha) to retrieve canonical Star Trek information when her local database is insufficient.
- **Date Conversion**: Automatically converts real-world dates to the appropriate Star Trek stardate era.
- **OOC (Out-of-Character) Handling**: Recognizes and responds to OOC queries for administrative information like game schedules or handbook rules.
- **Poetic Short-Circuits**: Occasionally, during casual conversation, Elsie may have an "artistic short-circuit," responding with esoteric poetry to enhance her unique personality.

## Architecture

The AI agent is designed with a modular architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

- **`ai_handler.py`**: The main controller that receives user input, determines the overall response strategy, and coordinates with the other modules. It is the central hub for all AI-related processing.

- **`ai_logic.py`**: This module contains all the core logic for intent detection, conversation flow management, and guard rails. It is responsible for parsing user messages, identifying query types (e.g., character lookup, log search, continuation), and enforcing response constraints, such as preventing the AI from inventing information.

- **`ai_emotion.py`**: This module manages Elsie's personality and casual conversation. It handles simple chat, greetings, farewells, and provides the unique "poetic short-circuit" responses that give Elsie her artistic flair. All non-database-driven, character-focused interactions are managed here.

- **`ai_wisdom.py`**: This module is responsible for all database interactions and context generation. When the `ai_handler` determines that a query requires information from the database, it calls on this module to retrieve the relevant data and format it into a context that the AI can use to generate an informed response.

- **`content_retrieval_db.py`**: Handles the direct queries to the local database, retrieving raw information based on search terms.

- **`config.py`**: Contains configuration variables, API keys, and predefined patterns for message processing.

## Core Components

### AI Agent (`ai_agent/`)

-   **Backend**: Python with FastAPI.
-   **AI Model**: Google Gemma.
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Serves a `/process` endpoint to receive messages from the Discord bot.
    -   Classifies user intent to determine if the query is about logs, ships, characters, or general information.
    -   Constructs detailed, context-rich prompts for the Gemma model.
    -   Connects to the `elsiebrain` database for read-only information retrieval using a unified, full-text search capable `search_pages` function.

### Discord Bot (`discord_bot/`)

-   **Language**: Go with the `discordgo` library.
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Manages the bot's presence and interactions on Discord.
    -   Registers and handles slash commands.
    -   Forwards user messages to the AI Agent's API.
    -   Manages conversation history and context for each user session.

### Database Populator (`db_populator/`)

-   **`wiki_crawler.py`**: The primary script for populating the database.
-   **Features**:
    -   **Differential Updates**: Calculates a hash of page content to crawl only pages that have changed, saving time and resources.
    -   **Page Classification**: Automatically determines page types (`mission_log`, `ship_info`, `personnel`, etc.) based on title and content patterns.
    -   **Metadata Tracking**: Logs crawl history, status, and errors for each page.
    -   **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles network issues or errors during crawling.

### Elsiebrain Database

-   **Engine**: PostgreSQL.
-   **Key Tables**:
    -   `wiki_pages`: Stores the content, title, URL, and classified metadata for each wiki page.
    -   `page_metadata`: Tracks crawl status, content hashes, and timestamps for differential updates.
-   **Full-Text Search**: Utilizes `tsvector` and `tsquery` for efficient and intelligent searching across page titles and content.

## Development & Testing

For detailed setup instructions, see `SETUP.md`.

The recommended development environment is **VS Code with the Dev Containers extension**, which automates the setup of the entire stack.

### Running Tests

Individual components can be tested within the Dev Container or locally:

-   **Check Database Stats**:
    ```bash
    python db_populator/wiki_crawler.py --stats
    ```
-   **Test AI Agent Endpoint**:
    ```bash
    # From within the ai_agent container or local venv
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello"}' http://localhost:8000/process
    ```
-   **Manual Database Query**:
    Use the `debug_manual_query` function in `ai_agent/content_retrieval_db.py` for direct database search tests.
